Typescript http://www.typescriptlang.org
 is a superset of javascript
 it is compiled language
 it is typesafe
 fully compatible to ES6 features
 when compiled using 'tsc' it genrates the js files
 control the compiler configurations using tsconfig.json
   -set the target version of JS in tsconfig.json
   - set whether source source map is required or not
 install typescript globally typescript compiler
   npm install -g typescript (it will install in system)
   to cmpile typescript file tsc index.ts
   tsc init will create tsconfig.json file
   to run js file node index.js 
   tsconfig.json- configuration file for tsc compiler

Module:
 A typescript file that contains set of exported members
 A exported member can be class, interface,function,constant
 export member using export keyword and import them in another file
 
 barrel is way of importing modules into another files in case of large applications
 we create index.ts file in that folder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Angular
 SPA (single page application) it is framework
 Angular follows MVC pattern
 cli support for creating,building,run application
 built in support for two way binding and dependency injection
 view rendering engine IV fronm Angular-8

angular cli
 npm install -g @angular/cli
 to check angular cli version: ng --version
 
 angular.json - project configuration file
first execution starts from main.ts file
Angular module
 it encapsulates 
components -UI for the application
          - home.component.ts
          - home.component.html
          - home.component.css
          - home.component.spec.ts -unit testing with karma & jasmine
directives
          - it is used to add/remove behaviour of a DOM element
          - use to change the appearance
pipes 
          - used to transform data while printing in html file
services 
            - these are injectible objects (Angular DI system create and manage the service object)
            - Reusable function code

imports sub modules(builtin/custom) 

A module is type script class decorated with @ngModule
declarations: components,directives,pipes
impors: any built in module
providers:service providers
Webpack dev server is used in visual studio code

Run angular application
  ng serve -o
  ng s -o

- Creating components
  ng generate component <component/name of components >

main module responsible to load other modules 

Dirctives - 
         - components- directives with a template
         - structural directive- changing DOM element by adding & removing
                   starts with * *ngFor,*ngIf
         -  Attribute directives: (click) change behaviour on click
           ngStyle: style attribute applying dynamically example range control
           ngClass:applying css class based on condition
           ng-container is used to use more than one structural directive
           ng-template ex: if else condition products nt available show as no content

       -Bindings
           Interpolation - {{variable}}
           Property binding - input binding -[]
              eg: [value]="variable"
           Event binding - Output binding - () 
              eg: (click)="Show()"
           Two way binding - [()] banana in box
       -Pipes
             - Pipes are used for formating data in templates.
             - pipes are applied using pipe symbol -|
             - Left side of the pipesymbol is the input value (arg) for the pipe function.
                 eg: {{value|pipename[:args]}}
                     {{ name|uppercase}}
                     {{ today|date:'dd-MMM-yyyy'}}    
             - Built in pipes
               - uppercase
               - lowercase
               - titlecase
               - json
               - number    
               - currency
               - date
               - async

             - Custom pipes 
                 - ng generate pipe [pipes/ipename] (command to generate pipe)
             - Create Project
                 ng new <projectname> [options]
                 ng new eshop-spa --minimal --skip-tests

              ng g interface models/product
              
Create services
             ng generate service services/servicename
             ng g services/product
             service can be registered globally and locally
             register globally in AppModule provider section
             disabled directive to disable the button
        - observables and promises
          used for Asynchronous programming
          Promises
           - it is built in feature of javascript
           - promises based on request-response pattern
example:
          function sum (a,b)
            {
return new Promise((resole,reject)=>{
        if (completed)
           resolve(total);
        else
           reject(err);
            }  
callback function is used in this promises will not update about changes in data automatically without request.
            
        - Observables
           - follows publish subscribe pattern
           - used for real time data updations
           - in observables cancellation token available
           - can modify received response/ operators are available with observables
           async pipe wait until actual result received
             
Forms in Angular
   - Two approaches for form creation: Template driven forms and Reactive forms
   - You can do validation and submission.
   - Template driven forms
      import form module into appmodule
      we use HTML5 validation attributes
      need to use ngModel directive for 2 way data binding
      Every form contrl must have a name attribute if we use ngModel
      Reference variable can also be used to access the form control
      Every control have some properties that defines state
          valid - invalid
          dirty - prestine  ( typed data or not)
          touched - untouched (focused in control or not)
       Forms also have valid and invalid property
   -Reactive forms:
     - we use Reactive forms module from '@angular/forms'
     - we use services like FormBuilder to create a form group
     - A formgroup is a class used to create model for form
     - we need to use directives like formgroup and formcontrolname
     - Validations are done in the model object(formgroup) using validation class(in code file)
     - form and control properties applicable here also

Json server is tool of node js(dummy backend server to mock backed api) 
command:json-server --watch eshop.json

Http Services
          - we need to use HttpClientModule that provides the HttpClient service
          -  it allows you to connect and fetch data from back end API server
          -  it provides get,post,put,put,delete and PATCH
          - THESE METHODS GENERIC METHOD AND RETURNS OBSERVABLE
INTERCEPTER: to make any http request/reesponse modification use intercepter

behavioursubject class is used to monitor an object which is convertible to observable type

Resolver maks sure that component get activated if data is loaded (first it loads data then activate component)

LifeCycle hooks:
- Constructor()
     Executes before binding data to properties
    - ngOnInit() - OnInit interface
      Executes after property data binding
    - ngOnChanges() - OnChanges interface
    - ngOnDestroy() - OnDestroy interface

Constructor
OnInit
DataBinding
constructor:before dom loaded
ngOnInit: After dom loads

Lazy Loading in Angular:
Feature Modules

http://localhost:4200/customers -> home page of customers
http://localhost:4200/customers/profile -> profile page of customers
command: ng generate module customers --route customer-route --module app.module
         ng g c customers/components/profile
         ng g c customers/components/orders
when we request customers page then only customers module loads which is a feature module. it is lazy loading concept

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         
Mongodb:
it is unstructured NoSql database which stores data in JSON format.
i need to store related data in one table
it is easy to store herarchical data
example: collection of customer in json format
customers"[
 {
"id":101,
"name":"abc",
"mobile":12345
"email":"abc@gmail.com",
"address":[
{ "id":1,"street":"abc", "City":"bbb", "state":"cc", "pin":222222},
{ "id":2,"street":"abc", "City":"bbb", "state":"cc", "pin":222222},
{ "id":2,"street":"abc", "City":"bbb", "state":"cc", "pin":222222},
],
}
];

Unstructured Data
   - Documents (JSON) - MongoDB, SQL API(DocumentDB-Cloud based database)
   - Key-Value pair   - Azure Table API, Redis Database
   - Graph -example: linked in connection - Gremlin database,Neo4j
   - Column family    - Cascendra

Mongodb is opensource driven by mongodb community
Onpremise nosql database that follows documents data storage
supports indexing and partitioning(also known as Sharding) for performance
HIGHLY SECURED (KERBAROS AUTHENTICATION)  
It uses BSON as data storage format and javascript as procedure and function        

Installing MongoDB
   - Install binary file(Installable), run as windows service.
   - Portable executable is vailable, download zip and extract. need to run explicitly
   - In the bin folde we can see mongodb server and client
        - Server - mongod.exe
        - Client Tool - mongo.exe(CUI Tool)
        - GUI Tool - VS code CosmosDB plugin, NoSql Booster for MongoDB
        - Migration TOOLS
            - mongomongoexport.exe
            - mongoimport.exe
            - mongodump.exe
            - mongorestore.exe   
c:\mongodb4.2.1\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath c:\mongodb4.2.1\data\db
save file as mongostart.cmd

- mongodb://[hostname/ipaddress]:27017
command mongodb\bin> mongo.exe
use eshop
Relationaldb vs NoSQL
database - database
Table - collection
Row - Document
Columns - Attributes

Every mongodb document have a unique identifier with _id
upsert:if matching document not there then insert 
Mongodb Aggregation: Agreegation is used combine data from multiple documents but on single collection only
                     - 3 types of agreegation
                      - Single purpose agreegation functions 
                       Ex:count(),distinct()
                      - AgreegationPipeline.
                        - An array of operation that executes one after another
                        - Result of one operation is the input of next operation
                        - we use operators like $match, $project, $sort, $unWind etc

      - Kestral is a cross platform lightweight web server.  
      - Program.cs
         - Contains main method that starts the host for MVC app.
         - Creates and starts a web host object
         - web host responsible to host application code 
         - Type of Host in .NET Core
         - Webost (ASP.NET MVC,WEBAPI Applications)
            - Generic Host( (Running background applications/tasks) No HTTP Pipeline
      -  Startup.cs
         - Configure the services for the application
             - ConfigureServices() method is used to configure the services required in the app
         - Creates a request pipeline for handling requests
             - Configure() method is used to configure the request pipeline.
             - Request pipeline defines how to handle the http request.
             - It contains a middleware with set of functions 
         - AppSettings.json
             - Configuration file that contains appsetting and connection strings    
         - wwwroot
             - this folder is default static files folder
         - .csproj file
             - contains the framework version and package informations
             - MetaPackage - Microsoft.AspNetCore.App
                - When developing MVC and API apps we need to use a bunch of dependencies
                - these packages are bundled in to virtual package(MetaPackage)
                - Metapackage name is Microsoft.AspNetCore.App
          - Controllers
                 - MVC and Web Api controllers are created here  

Execution Flow:
 Request1 => Run =>Response
Middleware:
 - Can be cared using
        - Use() method
            Used to created custom middleware
            it takes a function as arg,that
- Built In Middleware
  UseDeveloperExceptionPage
     - Used to display detailed error page while running in development
     - Apply this middleware conditionally,while in development
 UseExceptionHandler()
     - Redirect the error responses to error page
     - it can be used to send custom error details
     - app.UseHsts()
     - UseHttpRedirection()
       - Automaticqally redirects all http requests to https
     - UseCookiePolicy
       - Adds a layer of security for cookie usage
       - Asks for permission to create cookie
     - app.UseMvc
       - Executes the controller actions based on the route requested
       - Checks the route table and decides which controller and action need to be executed
       - Routing url templates can be defined in middleware
       - UseMvcWithDefaultRoute() applies a middleware with default route template
       - UseMvc() applies a routing middleware that allows custom routing template
     - UseStaticFiles()
          is required to server the static files for the application
          Default static file folder is wwwroot
          This can be used multiple times in request pipeline
          Use parameters to define static file directories and options other than wwwroot
     - UseDirectoryBrowser()
          Enable directory browsing
     - UseDefaultFiles()
          - Serve the default file when root URL is requested
          - Can configure custom document also
     - Services
          - Services are reusable codes in an application
          - Services need to be registered in ConfigureServices method of Startup class
          - .net core DI system creates and inject the instance of a service wherever is required
          - IOC container will take care of the object life time and scope.
          - Services can be registered with the following scopes and lifetime:
            - Singleton
              - A single instance of service is created and maintained till end of application
              - Services.AddSingleTon() method to register a service as singleton
            - Scoped
              - A single instance per request scope.
            - Transient
              - It creates a new instance everytime wherever it is required
              - Short lived objects   
          - Builtin DI system can be replaced by third party IOC containers :(Autofac)
                DEPENDENCIES ARE REMOVED AS CONTROLLERS ARE NOT DEPEND ON SERVICE CLASS
      - Configuration Sources
         - Configuration means the parameters passed to the application for execution
         - Such as application settings, connection strings etc
         - passed as Key-Value pair format.
         - we have many configuration sources in .NET Core App:
              - Command Line ars
              - Environment variables
              - InMemory Cllections 
              - Appsettings.json (JSON files)
              - XML files
              - INI files
              - Key Per File
              - Azure Key Vault
         - When the default webhost builder created a webhost, it comes with some predefined configuration
 sources such as Cmd Line args, Env variables and Appsetting.json
         - priory: Command Line Args(command prompt),Environment Variables  

         - configuration sources can be read using POCO classes    
           
    ASP.NET MVC
         - Every controller inherits from the controller
         - Every action has a return type of IActionResult.        
         - In attribute routing the [RoutePrefix] is replaced by [Route] atrtribute
         - Action selector (HttpGet) attribute can be used for definig URI for action
         - Tag Helpers
            - Tag Helper is c# class that can be used to create custom tags and attributes
            - A tag helper will be converted in to HTML element.  
            - ASP.NNET provides set of built in tag helpers. we create custom tag helpers
            - Custom tag helper classes inherits from TagHelper class
            - If we register tag helper in _ViewImpors file then it will be available in all views
 Caching in ASP.NET
    - Used for application performance improvement
    - Instead of regenrating the data or response we can store the data and response in a storage
 for a temporary period of time
    - Caching methods in ASP.NETcore:
       - Response Caching
          [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
           ResponseCach attribute is used for caching
       - In-memory Data Caching
           - Locally cahe data within application machine
           - This is not reliable
           - AbsoluteExpiry vs SlidingExpiry
           - Add inmemory cache service to service collection by calling AddMemoryCache()
           - Inject the IMemoryCache in the controller to get access to cache object
       - Distributed caching
           - Which store the cache data outside the application
           - we can use sqlserver or radis server to cache data
           - we use IistributedCache interface to get access to the distributed cache service
           - Distributed Cache providers:
              - InMemory DistributedCache
                 - Only for Development purpose
              - sqlServer Distributed cache
              - Radis cache  
       - Distributed caching       
    Command to create table using command:
    dotnet sql-cache create "Data Source=10.2.33.35;Initial Catalog=chandan;Integrated Security=True" "dbo" "CacheTable22" 
      Redis DistributedCache
          - Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRadisCache package
 - .NET Core State Management
    - Query Strings
    - Hidden Fields
    - Cookies
    - Session
       - Session is not default enabled
       - one of the distributed cache must be enabled to use session
       - session data is stored in distributed cache for reliability
       - To use session we need to add the session service in the service collection
            - service.AddSession();
       - Also we need to use the session middleware to work with session
            - app.UseSession();
       - Session stores data in string and byte[] format(because of distributed storage)  
    - Temp Data
          - ASP net core provides two tempdata providers:
            -Cookie based tempdata provider
            - Session based tempdata provider 
    - DI
        - we have to use singleton service object for state management
        - In one controller we are setting value and in other we are accessing same value 
    - Caching
    - HttpContext.items:
      it is used for validation in middleware before sending data to controller action

   - .NET Core Deployment Types
    fdd(Framework dependent deployment)
        - dotnet app.dll
        - shared libraries and framework are not part of app deployment
        - Runtime must be installed in machine
        - Application can be run using "dotnet myapp.dll"
    SCD:
    Self contain deployment: <RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64<RuntimeIdentifiers>
    project folder>> dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64
      - Runtime is also published in to deployment folder
      - no runtime required in machine
      - Specify the RID in the .csproj file      
         <RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64<RuntimeIdentifiers>
      - Publish using following command
        dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64
    FDE:Framework dependent executables
       - Shared libraries and framework are not part of app deployment
       - Runtime must be installed in machine
       - it creates a self executable exe file in publish folder

Entity Framework Core
       - Entity classes and DbContext class
       - Configure the DbContext service in ConfigureServices method.
       - For production we use sqlserver as database 	
       - Database sources:
          - inmemory
          - SqlServer
       - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore namespace 
Migration Command
        Add-Migration "InitialCreate"
        Update-Database
        Add-Migration "ProductUpdated" 
        Update-Database

Microservices Architecture
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 -What is monolithic architecture?
       - All application modules are part of single project
       - Features:
            - Old and easy approaches
            - No headache of implementing communication
            - Easy to deploy and develop
            - Tightly coupled
            - Choice of languages and frameworks are less
            - Every time we need to redeploy the app when a change comes in any module
            - Scaling of individual module not possible (like only scale catalog module)
            - limited/complex polyglot persistance 
 - SOA Architecture
            - Create each module of app is created as indivijually deployable projects
            - We use a communication channel which is used by all modules.
               - ESB - Enterprice Service Bus (ESB Mule)
            - All modules shares a common database
 - Microservices
            - Indivijually developed,tested and deployed
            - They never share the database
            - Any service can communicate to any other service directly
            - Every service is exposing a well defined end point -Rest endpoint
            - Communication patterns:
                 - HTTP BASED - REST
                 - Message based - Queues (MSMQ) 
            - in SOA communication happens through ESB and shares database
            -Communication Patterns:
             - REST based (http)
                - Nearly real time
                - Synchronous in nature
                - one to one communication
                - For every request there is a response received
             - Queue based
                - Not real time communication
                - Asynchronous in nature  
                - One to many and one to one supported
                - No response required for message based
             - Event based Communication
                - Nearly real time
                - Asynchronous
                - One way communication
                - No response received
                - One or more event handlers can catch the event data
             - Choice of languages and frameworks
             - Database not shared
             - Independently developed and deployed    
             - Independently scalable services
            - .net Core Web API
              - every controller is inheriting from ControllerBase
              - View result,cookies,viewbag provided by controller class but in webapi these are not needed in 
                webapi so controllerbase is used 
              - Every controller is decorated with [ApiController] attribute
                   [FromBody] no need to specify
              - No RoutePrefix for controller, Route() is used instead of defining prefix
              - No Route() attribute required for action, Http method selector attribute c
               can define the template and Route name      
              - Method return type:
                 - Void
                 - Specific types such as string,boolean, integer
                 - HttpResponsemessage
                 - ActionResult<T> - Recommended
                 - In MVC-RETURN TYPE IActionResult AND IN CORE API ActionResult<t>   
              - CORS Policies
                 - Defines a set of rules that tells the API to allow certain domain,methods   
              - OPEN api Documnentation 
                 - FOR WEB SERVICES WE GET SERVICE DOCUMENTATION USING wsdl FILE
                 - for restful services we can use open API specification doc(Swagger doc)
                 - We can use Swashbucle.AspNetCore package to configure the Swagger Doc  
                 - to see documentation:http://localhost:59446/swagger/v1/swagger.json 
              - Enable Xml Serializer
                  - Use the AddXmlDataContactSerializerFormatters() method with services.AddMvc();
                  - Default json is enabled
             - Authentication for Web API
                  - No login GUI is provided for APIS
                  - Use tokens for authentication. (OAUTH Token, JWT Token)
                  - A token is an encrypted text that contains the audiance(api),issuer(identity),claims (roles and other info),
                    expiry time,Algorithem and secret code	
                    - JWT Token

RabitMQ
  -Communication Patterns:
      - Restful services - synchronous
      - Message based - Asynchronous, one to many,not realtime
      - Event driven architecture - Asynchronous, one to many, real time
  - messaging
      - Two applications can communicate asynchronously
      - A small text message is sent to message broker
      - A message broker is an agent that provides message based communication.
        - Features:
           - Provides storage for messages
           - Different message delivery patterns
               - Direct - one to one
               - Topic - Pattern based (multicast)
               - Fanout - Broadcasting to everyone
          - Deliver message when recepient comes online
          - TTL - Time to Live - Undelivered messages can be moved to dead letter queue.
       - Message Broker: Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage Queue, RabbitMQ

Docker:
process: when an application goes to running state it is a process
  - Images:
       - Containerized application is called image.
       - Image is used to create instance of application
       - The running instance is called container
       - Every container have unique Id and name
       - Every image also have unique id and name
       - image name must be in <imagename>:<tag> format
             - tag is version identifier or unique value that can be used to identify image
              eg:eshop-web:1.0
        - if tag name is not supplied at the time of image creation,it will be assigned to 'latest' by default  
        - An image contains a set of layers
           Every layer ha unique Id
        - Repositories (registries)
           - is a storage place for code and data
           - A docker image repository is place to store images.
           - Repositories can be local and cloud
                Local:
                   - Store locally in dev machine
                   - Local repo images name can be anything, without repo name
                Cloud:
                    - Publically accesible repository
                    - Anyone can access it from here.
                    - Two types:
                        - public
                           - When uploading in to public repo it is accessible to all without any credentials
                           - DockerHub is an example for public repo
                           - sonu/calculator:latest is uploaded by sonu
                           - chandan/calculator:latest uploaded by chandan  
                        - private
                            - Secured repository
                            - it needs credentials to push and pull images.
                            - Azure container Registry(ACR),Elastic Container registry(ECR)            
               
docker commanFor docker images https://hub.docker.com/
docker pull nginx
docker run -p 8090:80 nginx

docker images
         - List all images located in local repo
docker run -p host-port:container-port -d --name nameofcontainer --rm imagename
- --name = used to assign a name for running container. if not used docker will assign a random name to the container
- -d= detached mode.
- --rm = remove the container when stopped. 
- -p = map host machine port number to container app port.
- docker stop <containerid/container name>
  - Stop a running container
docker ps -a
      - list all running and stopped containers
docker rm<containerID/name>
      - Remove the stopped containers 
docker rm -f <containerID/name>
      - Stop and remove running containers 
docker run -p 7010:80 -d --name "nginx1" nginx

Building images:
        - A set of commands needs to be executed
        - Commands can be written into file called "Dockerfile"
        - The instruction to build an iamge may start with following keywords:
             - FROM <baseimagename>
                - Specify the base image for our application.
                - eg: From nfinx:latest
             - LABEL <KEY>=<VALUE>
                 used to add meta information for image such as author info,version,company etc
                 label author "kedar"
                 label version 1.2.0
            - RUN <cmd> <args>
                 Execute a command while building the image
                 RUN dotnet restore && RUN dotnet build && RUN dotnet publish 
            - WORKDIR <DIR_PATH> (setting current working directory in container)
                 - set the current working directory inside the container
                 - WORKDIR /usr/app
                 - WORKDIR C:\Users\myapp
            - COPY <source files/pattern> <dest_path>
                 - Copy files fro local machine to docker image path
                 - Copy ./*.jpg
            -ENV <envvariablename> <value>
                 - Used to set the environment variable value for the app.
            - EXPOSE<port-number>
                 - Specify the port number to opened
            - CMD <command>v<args>
                 - Execute commands when container is created
                 - When image is running 
            - ENTRYPOINT <cmd> <args>
                 - Execute commands when the container is created.
                 - When image is running
                 - It is used to specify the starting the command of application
     Network types:
      Bridge:hostport:containerport
      Host
      None       
     - Building docker images
              docker build -t <imagename:tag> <dockerfilepath>
              ex: D:\staticweb>docker build -t mysampleapp:v1 .  (where . is current directory path) 
              docker run -p 7010:80 --name "myapp1" mysampleapp:v1 
              D:\staticweb>docker run -p 7030:80 -d  --name "myapp3" mysampleapp:v1
              docker ps (all running image)
              docker stop myapp3
              docker ps -a (it will show all available images)
              D:\staticweb>docker start myapp1 ( it will start existing image)
     - Containerizing .NET Core Apps
            - Download sdk and runtime images
              docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2.7-bionic   (runtime)
              docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2.402-bionic    (sdk)  
     - Remove docker image
             - docker rmi <imageid/name> 
             - docker  rmi [-f] <imageid/name>
